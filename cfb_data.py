"""College football data: the board, ten seasons of history, and the join.

This is the CFB counterpart to the NFL project's data.py, and it is a rewrite
rather than a port because every input differs. What carries over is the set
of mistakes already paid for, each of which is prevented here by construction:

* **The board comes from the lobby, not the API.** api.draftkings.com answers
  403 to GitHub runners. www.draftkings.com/lineup/getavailableplayers answers
  200 with the whole slate, in an abbreviated dialect - fn/ln, s, pn.

* **Position is `pn`, never `pp`.** `pp` is an integer that is zero for every
  player on the board. Mapping position to it once produced 850 players
  sharing a single position called `0`, which makes every positional
  constraint vacuous and a lineup of eight quarterbacks perfectly legal.

* **Team codes do not join; fixtures do.** DraftKings writes BAMA, TA&M, RU;
  CFBD writes Alabama, Texas A&M, Rutgers. Two of twenty-four matched by
  string. `UL` is Louisiana to DraftKings and reads equally well as
  Louisville, and nothing about the string settles it - but a fixture must
  match exactly one CFBD fixture on BOTH sides, and that does settle it.

* **Names need two spellings, not one.** DraftKings writes "AJ Swann", CFBD
  writes "A.J. Swann". Period-to-space gives "aj swann" and "a j swann",
  which do not match; period-to-nothing breaks "St.Brown" instead. Both rules
  are right and they contradict, so both keys are carried and either may hit.

* **The live week is fetched, not calculated.** Probing showed the season's
  completed-game count equal to weeks 1 and 2 exactly while week 3 sat
  scheduled with zero played. A clock-based guess would have asked for a week
  that does not exist yet and quietly returned nothing.

* **Captain salary is charged, not assumed.** On Showdown the captain costs
  1.5x salary as well as scoring 1.5x points. Reading only the points
  multiplier builds lineups that cannot be entered.
